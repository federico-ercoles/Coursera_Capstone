        "In order to achieve that, I will use location data from Foursquare for both the neighborhoods of New York City and Toronto, extracting for each neighborhood the 10 most common venues in the area. In New York City's dataset, each venue category will get assigned a value between these:\n",

        "* 0: not very useful; for example, Spas, Hotels, Pubs or Juice Stores;\n",
        "* 1: convenient to have nearby; for example, Restaurants, and Gyms; \n",
