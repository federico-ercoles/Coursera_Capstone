        "<li>not very useful: for example, Spas, Hotels, Pubs or Juice Stores;\n",
        "<li>convenient to have nearby: for example, Restaurants, and Gyms; \n",

        "The Logistic Regression model trained on these values will then use Toronto's dataset of most common venues per neighborhood to predict their suitability for a family with small children.</p>"
